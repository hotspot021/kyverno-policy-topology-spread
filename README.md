Rationale:
DevOps are responsible for providing working kubernetes cluster with minimum effort for developers to deploy their applications. 
Developers write their own applications manifests (like Deployment, Services, Ingresses), but they donâ€™t want to deal with AWS related stuff like zones and high availability. 
K8s administrator can enforce some of those rules inside the kubernetes cluster.

Task:
Implement kubernetes policies that will make sure pods for each application are balanced as much as possible across all available zones. 

Solution:
K8s policy engine like Kyverno works as custom mutating admission webhook.
At scheduling, it evaluates where to place given pod based on pre-defined rules.

Cons:
It doesn't take care of already deployed pods.
It may clash with taints or node affinity (if used).
